# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-time Network Monitoring feature transforms Cortexa's Heimdal sensor from static pcap file analysis to live network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection. As the local edge component of the Cortexa hybrid architecture, Heimdal will continuously monitor network behavior, maintain local behavioral baselines, detect anomalies, and forward anonymized metadata to the Asgard cloud platform for global threat intelligence. This feature enables the critical data pipeline that feeds Asgard's machine learning models while providing immediate local protection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the Heimdal sensor to continuously monitor live network traffic, so that I can detect threats as they happen rather than analyzing historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Heimdal sensor starts THEN the system SHALL begin capturing live network packets from all devices on the network
2. WHEN live packets are captured THEN the system SHALL process them in real-time without storing them to disk by default
3. WHEN the system processes packets THEN it SHALL maintain performance with less than 100ms latency per packet
4. IF packet processing falls behind THEN the system SHALL implement buffering to prevent packet loss
5. WHEN the sensor is stopped THEN the system SHALL gracefully close all network monitoring processes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to continuously update device behavioral baselines from live traffic, so that the threat detection becomes more accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN live packets are processed THEN the system SHALL update the existing baseline.json file with new behavioral patterns
2. WHEN a new device is detected THEN the system SHALL create a new baseline entry for that device
3. WHEN device behavior changes gradually THEN the system SHALL adapt the baseline to reflect normal evolution
4. IF baseline updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a rolling window of the last 7 days of behavior
5. WHEN baseline data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL automatically purge entries older than 30 days

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a home user, I want real-time anomaly detection that compares current behavior to learned baselines, so that I'm immediately alerted to potential security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN live packets are processed THEN the system SHALL compare current behavior against the established baseline
2. WHEN anomalous behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL generate an alert within 5 seconds
3. WHEN an alert is generated THEN the system SHALL include device identification, anomaly type, and severity level
4. IF multiple anomalies occur from the same device THEN the system SHALL correlate them into a single incident
5. WHEN anomaly severity exceeds critical threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic enforcement actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable monitoring parameters and thresholds, so that I can tune the system for my specific network environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load monitoring configuration from a config file
2. WHEN configuration includes anomaly thresholds THEN the system SHALL use those values for detection
3. WHEN configuration specifies monitoring interfaces THEN the system SHALL only monitor those network interfaces
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use safe default values and log warnings
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload settings without requiring a restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As the Asgard cloud platform, I want to receive anonymized metadata from Heimdal sensors, so that I can build global threat intelligence and device behavioral profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN Heimdal SHALL anonymize device and network details before transmission
2. WHEN device behavior is analyzed THEN Heimdal SHALL send anonymized behavioral metadata to Asgard API endpoints
3. WHEN new devices are discovered THEN Heimdal SHALL transmit anonymized device fingerprints to Asgard
4. IF Asgard API is unavailable THEN Heimdal SHALL queue metadata locally and retry transmission
5. WHEN transmitting data THEN Heimdal SHALL ensure no personally identifiable information is included

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Heimdal sensor, I want to receive threat intelligence updates from Asgard, so that I can protect the local network with global knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Heimdal starts THEN it SHALL register with Asgard and request current threat intelligence
2. WHEN Asgard identifies new threats THEN Heimdal SHALL receive and apply updated detection rules
3. WHEN Asgard provides device "Golden Profiles" THEN Heimdal SHALL integrate them into local baseline comparisons
4. IF Asgard pushes enforcement actions THEN Heimdal SHALL evaluate and apply appropriate local protections
5. WHEN intelligence updates are received THEN Heimdal SHALL log successful integration and version information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a network owner, I want local logging and diagnostics from Heimdal, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand what's happening on my network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Heimdal processes packets THEN it SHALL log packet counts, processing times, and error rates locally
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN Heimdal SHALL log detection details for local review
3. WHEN Heimdal communicates with Asgard THEN it SHALL log API call status and response codes
4. IF errors occur during monitoring THEN Heimdal SHALL log error details and continue operating
5. WHEN logs are written THEN Heimdal SHALL rotate log files to prevent disk space issues
