## 1. The Problem

The average network is no longer just a few computers. It's a complex, chaotic ecosystem of smart TVs, cameras, speakers, locks, and other IoT devices. These devices are notoriously insecure, have no user-facing protection, and create a massive, undefended attack surface for bad actors.

Traditional security tools (like anti-virus) are blind to these devices, and legacy firewalls are too complex for the average user. This leaves a critical gap in security, and users have **zero visibility** into what their devices are doing or who they are talking to.

## 2. Our Solution

**Cortexa** is an autonomous security platform that acts as an **intelligent immune system** for the entire network.

Instead of relying on outdated signature-based methods (looking for known "viruses"), Cortexa monitors the network, learns the unique **behavioral "DNA"** of every device, and neutralizes threats by detecting anomalous activity.

It answers the simple question: "Are my devices acting normally?"

## 3. Core Architecture

Cortexa is built on a hybrid architecture that combines a powerful local sensor (**Heimdal**) with a global cloud intelligence platform (**Asgard**).

### Heimdal (The Local Sensor)

Heimdal is the "guardian" that sits on the user's network. Its job is to see everything and act instantly.

* **Platform:** A lightweight agent, initially deployed on a Raspberry Pi (or similar).
* **Traffic Interception:** Uses ARP Spoofing to non-intrusively position itself as the network's gateway to monitor all traffic.
* **Device Fingerprinting:** Intelligently identifies every device on the network (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro", "Samsung Smart TV", "TP-Link Camera").
* **Local Baselining:** Learns the normal behavior of the local network ("What is normal for *this* network?").
* **Enforcement:** Can instantly block or quarantine a device if it detects a critical anomaly.
* **Reporting:** Sends anonymized metadata (e.g., "A 'Samsung Smart TV' talked to a new server in Russia") to Asgard for deeper analysis.

### Asgard (The Global Brain)

Asgard is the central cloud platform that aggregates data from all Heimdal sensors to become smarter over time. This is our core competitive advantage (Network Effect).

* **Collective Intelligence:** Ingests anonymized metadata from thousands of networks.
* **"Golden Profile" Generation:** By analyzing 100,000 "Samsung Smart TVs," Asgard builds a statistically perfect behavioral model ("Golden Profile") of what that device should *ever* be allowed to do.
* **Zero-Day Threat Detection:** Uses Machine Learning to identify new attack patterns as they emerge across the globe.
* **Intelligence Distribution:** Pushes new rules, signatures, and "vaccines" back to every Heimdal sensor, protecting all users from threats seen by even one.

## 4. Project Goals

* **Simplicity:** Create a "zero configuration" security product that is accessible to everyone.
* **Visibility:** Turn the "black box" of the network into a simple, understandable dashboard.
* **Proactive Protection:** Move from reactive (signature-based) to proactive (behavior-based) security.
* **Scalability:** Build a platform that can protect home networks, small businesses, and eventually enterprise IoT.

## 5. Current Status

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept (POC) - In Progress**

* [x] Setup Raspberry Pi 5 as a base sensor.
* [x] Successfully intercept local network traffic (ARP Spoofing).
* [x] Capture traffic to a static `pcap` file.
* [x] **Core Milestone:** Write basic Python scripts (`scapy`) to:
    * [x] Read `pcap` files.
    * [x] Generate a `baseline.json` file (the "normal" state).
    * [x] Monitor a *new* `pcap` file and detect anomalies by comparing it to the baseline.
* [ ] **Next Step:** Move from static `pcap` analysis to real-time, live packet monitoring.

## 6. Getting Started

(Instructions to be added once the POC is more mature.)
